## Workshop #1 Summary
In this workshop, we developed the **first phase of the project**, which included:

- **Competition review:** Understanding the *Psychopathy Prediction Based on Twitter Usage* challenge organized by the Online Privacy Foundation (2012).  
- **Preliminary problem analysis:** Identifying the main objectives (predicting psychopathy in Twitter users) and understanding the evaluation metrics.  
- **Initial data exploration:** Reviewing the dataset characteristics (≈2,927 users, over 3 million tweets, 337 derived variables).  
- **Work plan design:** Defining tasks and team roles for data collection, feature engineering, and preparation for machine learning models.  
- **Complexity discussion:** Identifying challenges such as extreme class imbalance, high dimensionality, and sensitivity to initial conditions.
