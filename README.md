## Workshop #1 Summary
In this workshop, we developed the **first phase of the project**, which included: 

- **Competition review:** Understanding the *Psychopathy Prediction Based on Twitter Usage* challenge organized by the Online Privacy Foundation (2012).  
- **Preliminary problem analysis:** Identifying the main objectives (predicting psychopathy in Twitter users) and understanding the evaluation metrics.  
- **Initial data exploration:** Reviewing the dataset characteristics (≈2,927 users, over 3 million tweets, 337 derived variables).  
- **Work plan design:** Defining tasks and team roles for data collection, feature engineering, and preparation for machine learning models.  
- **Complexity discussion:** Identifying challenges such as extreme class imbalance, high dimensionality, and sensitivity to initial conditions.

## Workshop #2 Summary
- During this second workshop, the team moved from the analytical phase carried out in Workshop #1 to the **design stage** of the psychopathy prediction system. The goal was to translate the previous findings—related to complexity, chaos, and sensitivity—into a clear and structured system proposal.

- Throughout the session, the group designed a **modular system architecture** capable of handling large volumes of linguistic and behavioral data from Twitter. This included defining how data would be collected, processed, and analyzed through different layers such as data ingestion, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

- Based on the challenges identified earlier, several design decisions were made to **control sensitivity and chaotic behavior**, including organizing the workflow to improve reproducibility and integrating mechanisms for feedback and monitoring during model development.

- The team also prepared an **implementation plan** that outlines the main stages of the project—from data preparation to deployment—and selected the tools that will support this process, such as Python libraries for analysis and GitHub for collaboration.
